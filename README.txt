There are 9 files in this repository. Files analysis_peg_f24.R and analysis_rib_f24.R 

contain separate TPR analyses on adherence to these two drugs in the first 24 weeks of 

the regime. The combined_f24.R and combined2_2stageest.R files contain the combined 

analyses of adherence to the two drugs jointly on two different time scales (weeks 

and days respectively). Also combined2_2stageest.R also contains codes for the two 

stage estimation (and testing) in the PFTPR model. The cumulative_analysis.R file 

contain TPR analyses of cumulative adherence scores for the drugs, separately and 

jointly. File diagnostic.R contain the diagnostic comparisons between the physiological 

and psychological scores of patients that were divided into two groups based on their 

adherence patterns on week 3 of the regime. the finite_bootstrap.R file studies the 

finite bootstrap performance of our proposed confidence bands of the estimated processes 

in the TPR model. The functions. R file contains several functions needed for 

the analyses, and the robustness_and_extra.R file contains certain additional analyses 

along with the robustness test for the interaction effect on week 3 in the weekly combined 

analysis of the two drugs.
